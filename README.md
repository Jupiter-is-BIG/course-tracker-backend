# UBC Course Tracker
This is a course tracking server side application for UBC courses. Suppose you want to register in a course COSC 111 001 for instance, but all the seats are full. Instead of checking SSC every other hour for a seat availablity, simply subscribe to the course on our server and get a discord bot notification as soon as a seat is available.
